# Hi, Iâ€™m WanXiang!

I am a Computer Science student at University at Buffalo. I have experience with Django, React, Git, and SQL, as well as multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C, and C++. I have also gained valuable research experience after interning in the Natural Language Processing lab of Virginia Commonwealth University.

**Experience**
<details open>
  <summary>Research Assistant (REU)<br>Virginia Commonwealth University<br>May 2024 - August 2024</summary>
  - Developed a Python script that extracts thousands of US patent data, including JSON data, text, and images, using the Google Patents API.<br>
  - Trained a Named Entity Recognition model using data that I preprocessed into Pandas DataFrames with the NLTK and Pandas libraries.<br> 
  - Used the trained model to perform Named Entity Recognition on the patent text files I created to label all chemicals found in the patents.<br>
  - Utilized Slurm Workload Manager and a high-performance computing cluster called Athena to train and test the Named Entity Recognition model.<br>
  - Read various research papers, created PowerPoint presentations on them, and gave presentations to groups of people in our lab.<br>
  - Created a scientific poster and described my research in a symposium.<br>

  <summary>US Patent Scraper</summary>
  - Utilized Python and the Google Patents API to get a list of all relevant patents after the user enters a search query.<br>
  - Developed code that automatically creates folders for all relevant patents found and saves each of their patent data, images, and text into the folders.<br>
  - Used Beautiful Soup to scrape text off patent webpages and regular expressions to process the text before writing them into text files.<br>

<details open>
  <summary>Dynamic Memory Allocator</summary>
  - Developed my own dynamic memory allocator based on the multi-pool allocation strategy, balancing between pool-based and bulk-based allocations.<br> 
  - Implemented malloc, calloc, and realloc to allocate memory and implemented free to give memory back to the system.<br>
  - Designed a doubly linked free list table to manage free memory blocks efficiently.<br>
